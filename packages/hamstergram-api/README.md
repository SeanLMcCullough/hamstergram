# `hamstergram-api`

This projects is built from my own Node DDD Boilerplate which is inspired by [joshuaalpuerto/node-ddd-boilerplate](https://github.com/joshuaalpuerto/node-ddd-boilerplate).
I quite like the structure so use it in practically all of my APIs when I'm starting out.
My modified version cuts out all of the auth stuff, database, and specifics, but keeps a similar directory structure and some index files.

## Usage

```
const hamstergramApi = require('hamstergram-api');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```
