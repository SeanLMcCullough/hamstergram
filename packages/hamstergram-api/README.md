# `hamstergram-api`

This projects is built from my own Node DDD Boilerplate which is inspired by [joshuaalpuerto/node-ddd-boilerplate](https://github.com/joshuaalpuerto/node-ddd-boilerplate).
I quite like the structure so use it in practically all of my APIs when I'm starting out. It effectively enforces good DDD by having abstractions of library methods and dependency injection.
My modified version cuts out all of the local auth stuff, database, and specifics, but keeps a similar directory structure and some index files.
