## Overview

This is an implementation of the [Adepto coding challenge (1)](https://bitbucket.org/adeptians/adepto-code-challenge/src/master/) to produce a basic social platform for Hamsters using a 3rd party authentication.



## User Stores

1. As a hamster, I want to sign up to a platform so I can connect with other the hamsters on the network
2. As a social hamster, I want to be able to share posts with hamsters in the network
3. As a social hamster I want the hamsters in the network to like my posts


## Implementation

For this implementation, I picked the following stack:

- Vue.JS for the front-end, as I find it clean, succinct, and consistent
- Node.JS for the back-end, a DDD express API with PassportJS for authorization
- Google Auth, as it is the most widely accepted and standards compliant
- MongoDB with Mongoose, as it is most applicable to Adepto's technical goals
- Docker to wrap it all up nicely
- Monorepo to keep the services together
- AWS S3 for the static website
